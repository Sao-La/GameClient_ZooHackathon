  Description: The saola is currently considered to be critically endangered. Its
    restrictive habitat requirements and aversion to human proximity are likely to
    endanger it through habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Saola suffer losses
    through local hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and
    for use of the meat in restaurants and food markets. They also sometimes get
    caught in snares that have been set to catch animals raiding crops, such as wild
    boar, sambar, and muntjac. More than 26,651 snares have so far been removed from
    Saola habitats by conservation groups.
