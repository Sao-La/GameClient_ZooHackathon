  Description: "In 2012 the nominate form of Edwards's pheasant have been uplisted
    to Critically Endangered by BirdLife International, having suffered from deforestation,
    hunting and the use of defoliants during the Vietnam War. The population is currently
    believed to number between 50 and 249 birds in the wild, mostly of the nominate
    form, but it is doing well in captivity, where it is the subject of ex-situ conservation.
    There have been no confirmed sightings of a living individual in the wild since
    2000 and in 2010 the World Pheasant Association (WPA) received funding from the
    Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund to survey forests in the central Vietnam
    provinces of Qu\u1EA3ng B\xECnh and Qu\u1EA3ng Tr\u1ECB."
