  Description: Tigers are near extinction in the wild that they could become extinct
    in the next 20 years. Their decline represents a crying visible failure to save
    endangered species and protect healthy environment. Fewer than 3,500 wild tigers
    live in 13 countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia,
    Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam) occupying less
    than 7% of their historical range, a dramatic plunge from an estimated 100,000
    a century ago with 40,000 tigers in India alone. Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and
    DPR Korea historically known to have stable populations are left with no evidence
    of breeding populations.
